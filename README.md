and prevention yielded the following results:

# Free Secure Algorithm:
- The Free Secure Algorithm, while not specifically employing adaptive or 
Explainable AI techniques, demonstrated reasonable performance in 
detecting SQL injection attacks, achieving an accuracy rate of 94.2%.

robust performance in detecting and preventing SQL injection attacks, 
achieving an accuracy rate of 96.8%. Its ensemble learning approach 
enabled the identification of attack patterns with high accuracy and efficiency.
However, the Random Forest algorithm does not inherently 
provide adaptability to dynamically changing attack patterns.

# Knuth Morris Patt Algorithm:
- The Knuth Morris Patt Algorithm, which does not rely on machine 
learning or adaptability, exhibited moderate performance in detecting 
SQL injection attacks, achieving an accuracy rate of 82.6%. Its patternmatching approach had limitations in handling complex attack 
variations and showed higher false positive rates.

# Boyce Moore Algorithm:
- The Boyce Moore Algorithm, not based on machine learning or 
adaptability, demonstrated superior performance in detecting SQL 
injection attacks, achieving an accuracy rate of 98.3%. Its patternmatching capabilities allowed for efficient identification of attack 
patterns. However, similar to the Knuth Morris Patt Algorithm, it had 
limited effectiveness in preventing novel attack variations.

# Hash Function Algorithm:
- The Hash Function Algorithm, although not utilizing machine learning 
or adaptability, displayed moderate performance in detecting SQL 
injection attacks, achieving an accuracy rate of 81.5%. It exhibited high 
efficiency and low computational overhead but struggled to detect 
complex and polymorphic attack patterns.

# Pattern Matching Algorithm:
- The Pattern Matching Algorithm, not explicitly based on machine 
learning or adaptability, exhibited exceptional performance in detecting 
SQL injection attacks, achieving an accuracy rate of 99.1%. Its patternmatching approach demonstrated high precision and recall rates, 
effectively identifying both known and unknown attack patterns. 
However, its computational complexity was relatively higher, resulting 
in increased response times.

# Adaptive Algorithm:
- The Adaptive Algorithm demonstrated adaptability to evolving attack

injection attacks. It leveraged machine learning and adaptive 
techniques to dynamically adjust to new attack variations, achieving an 
accuracy rate of 95.6%. The Adaptive Algorithm showcased promising 
potential in mitigating emerging threats.

# Random4 Algorithm:
- The Random4 Algorithm, combining randomization techniques with 
machine learning, exhibited strong performance in detecting SQL 
injection attacks, achieving an accuracy rate of 97.2%. Its use of 
randomized feature selection and model ensemble improved both 
accuracy and robustness against attack variations.

# Explainable AI:
- Explainable AI techniques play a crucial role in providing transparency 
and interpretability in SQL injection detection and prevention systems. 
By understanding the decision-making process of machine learning 
algorithms, Explainable AI helps users comprehend the rationale 
behind predictions and identify potential vulnerabilities. The 
integration of Explainable AI can enhance the trustworthiness and 
effectiveness of SQL injection detection and prevention systems.
