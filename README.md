# SQL-Injection-Detection-and-Prevention
- Based on the comparative analysis, machine learning algorithms such 
as Random Forest and Random4 Algorithm, along with adaptive 
approaches like the Adaptive Algorithm, demonstrated superior 
performance in detecting and preventing SQL injection attacks. These 
algorithms exhibited high accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability to 
evolving attack patterns. Furthermore, the integration of Explainable 
AI techniques can enhance the transparency and interpretability of 
SQL injection detection and prevention systems, aiding in identifying 
vulnerabilities and building trust. Organizations should consider the 
specific requirements of their environment and the trade-offs between 
accuracy, efficiency, adaptability, and interpretability when selecting an 
algorithm for SQL injection detection and prevention
